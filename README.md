# Getting started
I've found that [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is a pretty nice way to handle python dependencies. After installing it, you can run
`pipenv run jupyter-lab` to get a nice interactive jupyter notebook to program in, or you can run `pipenv shell` to access the virtual environment shell.
